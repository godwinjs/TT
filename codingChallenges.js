    You're keeping score for a baseball game with string rules. The  game consists of several rounds, where the score of past rounds may affect future rouns' scores.
    At the begining of the game, you start with an empty record. You're given a list of strings ops, where ops[i] is the ith operation you must apply to the record and is one of the following;

        0. An integer x records the new score of x.
        0. "+" - Record a new score that is the sum of the sum of the previous two scores, it is guranteed there will always be two previous scores.
        0. "D" - Record a new score that is double the previous score, It is guaranteed there will always be a previous score.
        0. "C" - Invalidate the prvious score, removing it from the record. It is guranteed there will always be a previous score.

    Return the sum of all the scores in the record.

    Example 1:
        Input ops = ["5", "2", "C", "D", "+"]
        Output: 10
        "5" - adds 5 to the record, record is now [5].
        "2" - adds 2 to the record, record is now [2].
        "C" - Invaldates and removes the previous score, record is now [5].
        "D" - Add 2 * 5 = 10 to the record, record is now, [5, 10].
        "+" - Add 5 + 10 = 15 to the record. record is now, [5, 10, 15]

        the total number to be returned is 5+10+15 = 30;
        
    Example 2:
        Input ops = ["5", "-2", "4", "C", "D", "9", "+", "+"]
        Output: 27

    Example 3:
        Input ops = ["1"]
        Output: 1

/*
    Think of a positive number n as a puzzle. Your challenge is to keep breaking down this number into its prime 
    pieces and adding them up. You'll do this repeatedly until n can't be broken down anymore. What you're looking 
    for is the smallest number that n can become after all these additions.
    Example 1:
        Input n = 9
        Output: 5
    Explanation: Initially, n=9.
        9-3 3, so replace n with 3+3=6.
        6-2 3, so replace n with 2+3=5.
        So 5 is the smallest value that can't be further broken down.
    Example 2:
        Input: n=2
        Output: 2
    Explanation: Initially, n = 2.
        So 2 is the smallest value that can't be further broken down.
        Constraints:
            2<n<=4*10e6

Plan
    Understand the problem: We need to break down the number into its prime factors, sum them, and repeat the process until we cannot break down the number further.
    Prime factorization: Implement a function to get the prime factors of a number.
    Iteration: Continuously replace the number with the sum of its prime factors until the number cannot be broken down further.
    Base cases: Handle the cases where the input number is already prime.
    Edge cases: Ensure the function works within the given constraints.

/*
Explanation
    Prime Factors Calculation: The getPrimeFactors function calculates the prime factors of a given number by dividing the number by the smallest possible divisor (starting from 2) and collecting the factors.
    Iteration to Find Smallest Value: The smallestValue function uses a loop to continuously replace the number ùëõ
    n with the sum of its prime factors until the sum remains unchanged (indicating it cannot be broken down further).
    This implementation ensures that we follow the process described in the problem statement and handle all potential edge cases effectively.
