/*
    Think of a positive number n as a puzzle. Your challenge is to keep breaking down this number into its prime 
    pieces and adding them up. You'll do this repeatedly until n can't be broken down anymore. What you're looking 
    for is the smallest number that n can become after all these additions.
    Example 1:
        Input n = 9
        Output: 5
    Explanation: Initially, n=9.
        9-3 3, so replace n with 3+3=6.
        6-2 3, so replace n with 2+3=5.
        So 5 is the smallest value that can't be further broken down.
    Example 2:
        Input: n=2
        Output: 2
    Explanation: Initially, n = 2.
        So 2 is the smallest value that can't be further broken down.
        Constraints:
            2<n<=4*10e6

Plan
    Understand the problem: We need to break down the number into its prime factors, sum them, and repeat the process until we cannot break down the number further.
    Prime factorization: Implement a function to get the prime factors of a number.
    Iteration: Continuously replace the number with the sum of its prime factors until the number cannot be broken down further.
    Base cases: Handle the cases where the input number is already prime.
    Edge cases: Ensure the function works within the given constraints.

/*
Explanation
    Prime Factors Calculation: The getPrimeFactors function calculates the prime factors of a given number by dividing the number by the smallest possible divisor (starting from 2) and collecting the factors.
    Iteration to Find Smallest Value: The smallestValue function uses a loop to continuously replace the number ùëõ
    n with the sum of its prime factors until the sum remains unchanged (indicating it cannot be broken down further).
    This implementation ensures that we follow the process described in the problem statement and handle all potential edge cases effectively.
